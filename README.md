# Portfolio-Website

A simple portfolio website made in Javascript/React to act as a repository for some of my coding projects and provide basic details about my education and experience.

I made this site mostly for practice and wanted to include additional features (such as a blogging component, a contact email forum, etc), but I have become pretty bored of working on this and would like to move on to something else. Because of this, the site is not fully completed, however, it has all of the basic functionalities and design-ideas that I was aiming for. 

The next time I work on this, I plan to include the aformentined features and refactor the entire code-base (maybe even use a separate language/framework altogther). However, by the time I do that, this project will have turned into something completely different.
